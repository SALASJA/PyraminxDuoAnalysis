The class is called BeadPyramid because I own a Moyu Bead Pyraminx
which is a Pyraminx Duo clone that I bought from The Cubicle.
The other class, Pyramid, is standalone and can be considered
to be the implementation of Moyu's Corner Twist pyraminx.
I made this program just to confirm that both puzzles
are able to be solved in 4 moves or less.
